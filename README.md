# Safe-MPC

This repo contains algorithms for Model Predictive Control, ensuring safety constraints and recursive feasibility.

## Installation
- Clone the repository\
`git clone https://github.com/idra-lab/safe-mpc.git`
- Install the requirements\
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- In nn_models are located the networks.
- Follow the instructions to install [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/get/), [Acados](https://docs.acados.org/installation/index.html) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

## Usage 
In config.yaml, set the simulation parameters.
```

```
